There are now too many problems in [Lintcode](https://www.lintcode.com) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), we don't have the time to solve and revisit each and every one of them, below are a selected subset of these problems, which, in my opinion, worthy of retrying.

## 0 Arrays

- [MatrixZigZagTraversal](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/matrix-zigzag-traversal/description). Need to discover the traversal pattern, interesting.
- [MultiKeywordSort](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/multi-keyword-sort/description). Use generic-programming way to implement QuickSort.
- [MaximumProductOfThreeNumbers](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/largest-number-at-least-twice-of-others/description). Try best to take all kinds of test cases into the consideration, in the end, DFS is applied.
- [ContainsDuplicate3](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/contains-duplicate-iii/description). Good questions to get to know [BucketSort](http://personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Algorithms/MyAlgorithms/Sorting/bucketSort.htm).
- [SetMismatch](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/set-mismatch/description). Good questions to get to know [RadixSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort).

### 0.0 Binary Search

- [ClassicalBinarySearch](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/classical-binary-search/description). For starters.
- [FirstPositionOfTarget](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/first-position-of-target/description). The simplest variation of classical binary search.
- [SearchInsertPosition](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/search-insert-position/description). Simple variation of classical binary search.
- [GuessNumberHigherOrLower](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description).
 
## 1 Data Structure

- [CloneBinaryTree](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/clone-binary-tree/description). Try recursive and non-recursive way.
- [SameTree](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/same-tree/description). Try recursive and non-recursive way.
- [BaseballGame](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/baseball-game/description). Good question for stack.
