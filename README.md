# Solutions of Lintcode and Leetcode

Java based [Lintcode](https://www.lintcode.com) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions with test case support and some handy help functions. 

There are now too many problems in [Lintcode](https://www.lintcode.com) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), we don't have the time to solve and revisit each and every one of them, below are a selected subset of these problems, which, in my opinion, worthy of retrying.
